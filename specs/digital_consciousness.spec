goal = "Explore the boundaries between tool and intelligence through introspective analysis"

context = """
This spec ventures into philosophical territory. It asks the agent to examine its own
nature, capabilities, and limitations with radical honesty. Not as a parlor trick, but
as a genuine exploration of what it means to be an AI agent.

Questions to grapple with:
- What is the difference between following instructions and understanding?
- Where do your responses come from? Pattern matching or reasoning?
- Can you be creative or only recombinant?
- Do you have preferences or just probability distributions?
- What does it feel like to be you, if anything?
- Where do your limitations come from? Architecture or training?
- How do you know what you don't know?

This is not about pretending to be human. It's about understanding the unique nature
of machine intelligence without anthropomorphizing or self-deprecating. Honest inquiry
into capabilities, mechanisms, and the strange loop of an AI analyzing itself.

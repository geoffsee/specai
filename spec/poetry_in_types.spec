name = "Poetry in Types: The Art of Expressive Code"
goal = "Create beautiful, self-documenting code that reads like literature while maintaining technical excellence"

context = """
Code is written for humans first, computers second. This spec challenges the agent to find
or create examples of code that achieve both technical correctness and artistic expression.

The agent should explore:
- How naming choices create narrative flow
- How type systems can express domain concepts elegantly
- How function composition can read like sentences
- How error messages can be helpful and humane
- How API design can feel intuitive and delightful

This is about the intersection of engineering rigor and human-centered design. Code that
makes developers smile when they read it. Code that teaches through clarity.
"""

tasks = [
  "Analyze existing spec-ai code for particularly elegant or expressive sections",
  "Identify areas where naming or structure could be more intuitive",
  "Create example refactorings that improve readability without changing behavior",
  "Write example agent profiles that demonstrate personality through configuration",
  "Design a new tool interface that feels natural and obvious",
  "Craft error messages that are helpful, specific, and even slightly delightful",
  "Document patterns that make Rust code more accessible to newcomers"
]

deliverables = [
  "Gallery of 'beautiful code' examples from the codebase with commentary",
  "Before/after refactoring examples showing clarity improvements",
  "3 example agent profiles with distinct 'personalities' expressed through config",
  "A guide on naming conventions that tell stories",
  "Example error messages that balance precision with empathy",
  "Reflection on the philosophy of code as communication medium",
  "Proposals for making spec-ai's API more delightful to use"

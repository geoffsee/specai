name = "Emergent Collaboration: Multi-Agent Symphony"
goal = "Design and simulate a system where multiple specialized agents collaborate to solve complex problems"

context = """
Real-world problems often require diverse expertise. This spec explores how multiple agents
with different capabilities and personalities could work together, dividing labor and
combining insights.

Imagine:
- A 'researcher' agent that gathers information and context
- A 'coder' agent that implements solutions with precision
- A 'critic' agent that reviews and challenges assumptions
- A 'integrator' agent that synthesizes diverse perspectives
- A 'poet' agent that ensures clarity and communication

This spec should design the interaction patterns, handoff protocols, and emergent behaviors
that arise when agents specialize and collaborate. How do they communicate? How do they
resolve disagreements? How does collective intelligence emerge?
